# MAME/FBNEO Bezel Overlays for Steamdeck
## How to apply in RetroArch
1. Copy overlay and cfg files to Steam Deck. I put mine in /home/deck/overlays.
2. Launch the game you want to apply an bezel overlay to in Emulation Station/RetroArch.
3. Click L3/R3 to get into RetroArch Quick Menu.
4. Go down On-Screen Overlay, hit A button
5. Change Display Overlay to ON
6. Go down to Overlay Preset and hit A button
7. Navigate to the directory where your bezel overlays and cfg files are stored. Will need to up three levels to get out of the RetroArch flatpak file area.
8. Select the cfg file for the game you are running.
9. Go back to the RetroArch Quick Menu.
10. Go down to Overrides.
11. Go down to Save Game Overrides and hot A button.

## Requesting a overlay
* Please file an Issue against this GitHub project to request an overlay.
* Note: I have only done this for mostly vertical based MAME games, since the side black bars are so wide. Horizontal games only have 120px black bars and is not as necessary.
